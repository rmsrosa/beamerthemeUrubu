## Urubu theme style file and the logo images

The main theme file `beamerthemeUrubu.sty` is under the [LaTeX Project Public License, Version 1.3c (LPPL-1.3c)](https://opensource.org/licenses/LPPL-1.3c).

The `beamerthemeUrubu.sty` loads the logo images `theme/img/002minerva_color_hor.png`, `theme/img/logoIM.png`, and `theme/img/ufrj-100-anos-colorido-horizontal.png`, which, however, are restricted to members of the [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro](https://ufrj.br) and the [Instituto de Matemática](http://www.im.ufrj.br).

Anyone associated with the [Instituto de Matemática](http://www.im.ufrj.br) is free to use the above mentioned logo images along with the `beamerthemeUrubu.sty`.

Those not associated with the [Instituto de Matemática](http://www.im.ufrj.br) may use the `beamerthemeUrubu.sty` according to the [LaTeX Project Public License, Version 1.3c (LPPL-1.3c)](https://opensource.org/licenses/LPPL-1.3c) as long as they remove or replace the above mentioned logo images or request the permission from the university to use them.

More information about these logos in [Minervas da UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/minervas) and [A UFRJ Faz 100 Anos - Logomarca](https://ufrj.br/ufrjfaz100anoslogomarca).
